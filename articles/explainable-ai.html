            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <div class="section-content">In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated into everyday life, understanding the decisions made by AI systems is paramount. **Explainable AI (XAI)** addresses this need for transparency and accountability in AI systems by providing clear insights into how these systems make decisions. At its core, XAI seeks to demystify complex models so that users—be they developers, stakeholders, or end-users—can grasp the reasoning behind AI outputs. The core problems that XAI addresses involve opacity in decision-making and the potential for biased or flawed outcomes. When AI systems operate as 'black boxes,' they can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or unjust outcomes that erode trust. Effective analogies can be drawn to how medical professionals explain diagnoses to patients, translating complex medical knowledge into understandable terms for informed consent. Historically, the quest for explainable AI can be traced back to early AI developments in the 1980s when researchers recognized the importance of transparency in expert systems. As AI models grew more complex and data-driven, particularly with the rise of deep learning in the 2010s, the issue of interpretability became increasingly critical. In this context, the scope of XAI encompasses a wide array of techniques and methodologies designed to illuminate AI behavior, focusing on ensuring ethical standards in AI deployment and fostering user trust in intelligent systems.</div>

                <h2 class="section-title">Core Architecture & Technical Specifications</h2>
                <div class="section-content">Understanding the core architecture of Explainable AI systems is crucial for developers and researchers alike. XAI combines multiple methodologies and technologies, including model-agnostic techniques and algorithm-specific approaches. At its foundation lies the concept of model interpretability, which can be viewed through two primary lenses: **global interpretability**—providing insights across the entire model—and **local interpretability**—assessing specific predictions. Describing the architecture involves understanding the flow of data within these models, often illustrated through flow diagrams highlighting stages from data input to model output. For instance, feature importance techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), represent critical components for achieving transparency. Tokenization, while often associated with natural language processing, is relevant in preprocessing data for XAI as it transforms input into a format suitable for model evaluation. Furthermore, understanding the hierarchy of feature importance and the impact of each feature on predictions can enhance the interpretability of the results. Memory windows, akin to those used in LLMs, help ensure contextual relevance in interpretive processes, and user prompt layers can enhance system interaction by facilitating user-friendly explanations.</div>
